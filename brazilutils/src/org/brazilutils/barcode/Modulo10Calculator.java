/**
 *  Computes the modulo 10 checksum digit for the data, providing a
 *  basic algorithm for the checksum calculation based on summing up
 *  alternated weights multiplied by data digits.
 *
 *  <p>The modulo 10 algorithm is based on weights. Suppose the data
 *  <code>"1234"</code> and the weights 3 and 1. The first step is done
 *  multiplying each data digit by the weights:</p>
 *
 *  <pre>
 *   1   2   3   4  --> data
 *   1   3   1   3  --> weights
 *  ---------------
 *   1   6   3  12
 *  </pre>
 *
 *  <p>Then the results are summed <code>1 + 6 + 3 + 12 = 22</code></p>
 *
 *  <p>The checksum is 22, but just one digit is returned, so the next
 *  multiple of 10 is 30. The difference is 8 that is the checksum digit.
 *  If the result is a multiple of 10, the checksum digit will be 0.</p>
 *
 *  <p><strong>NOTE</strong> The weights are applied from right to left.</p>
